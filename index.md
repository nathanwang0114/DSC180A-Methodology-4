**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is how microbiome data is sequenced, more specifically the differences between 16s rRNA short read sequencing versus long read sequencing, and shotgun metagenomics sequencing. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potentinal investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is to compare absolute and 
relative abundance tables, and to potentially extract absolute abundance values from relative abundance.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
We would ideally be using a different and larger dataset compared to our replication dataset as our mentor 
Rob Knight has offered us some very interesing datasets to explore.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Other techniques I would be interested in using my project are using differential abundance analysis techniques like ANCOM-BC, ALDEx2, and Songbird, using long read sequencing to get a higher resolution of taxonomic structure, and using qPCR in order to obtain estimated absolute abundances from 16s rRNA sequence samples.
